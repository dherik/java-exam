    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>
        This exam is applicable for Junior, Middle and Senior developers. So, feel free to show your skills in the exercises accord with your level. Pay more attention
        in produce a code with a good quality (no bugs, using OOP correctly, test, good code coverage in test, etc). The number of exercises made is not so important.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first exercise (Hello World) is already done in the exam. As you can see in the Hello World example, split each exercise in his own package, like the Hello World example.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can't import another libraries into maven to resolve the exercises.
    </p>
    <p>
        Create unit tests are not mandatory, but count a lot of points.
    </p>
    <p>
        The build cannot be broken (with errors) when you finish the exam. The <code>mvn clean install</code> command needs to build the project with success as result.
